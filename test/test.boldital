To ''italicize text'', put two consecutive apostrophes on each side of it.

Three apostrophes each side will '''bold the text'''.

Five consecutive apostrophes on each side (two for italics plus three for bold) produces '''''bold italics'''''.

'''''Italic and bold formatting''''' works correctly only within a single line.
